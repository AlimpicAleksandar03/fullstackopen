(user makes a new note)
there are no method and action tags in the form element, but spa.js has some changes how form is defined
this time server doesnt redirect the browser, rather responds with status code 201
spa.js creates a new note on form submit event, and refreshes the page, then sends json string to the server.

browser -> server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa (request body is json: {content: "single page app does not reload the whole page", date: "2019-05-25T15:15:59.905Z"})
server -> browser: json ({"message":"note created"})
